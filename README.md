$$Implementation$$

Either of the above discussed frameworks. i.e Asymmetric and Symmetric
key cryptography can be used to secure the transaction over the internet.
The main concern here is not the cryptography that is used but instead how
that can happen in secure and effective manner.
The amount of information a client submits to an online retailer is
limited by asking for only the information necessary to verify that the customer
used its bank account to make the payment. By establishing a central
Certified Authority (CA) and combining the use of steganography and
cryptography, this is accomplished.
